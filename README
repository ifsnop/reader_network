reader_network 0.70 - A package of utilities to record and work with
multicast radar data in ASTERIX format. (radar as in air navigation
surveillance).

Work in progress. Although I use this software everyday (in a realtime quality
monitorization environment), this software is EXPERIMENTAL.

See bin/conf/example.conf as a working example of the reader_network
config file. All options are detailed inside.

If you want to understand what ASTERIX is and how it is used, you
should check the following documents from EUROCONTROL and the

What is ASTERIX ?

ASTERIX is the EUROCONTROL Standard for the exchange of Surveillance related data.
The acronym stands for "All Purpose STructured Eurocontrol SuRveillance Information EXchange".

ASTERIX provides a structured approach to a message format to be applied in the exchange of surveillance related information for various applications. Developed by the SuRveillance Data Exchange Task Force (RDE-TF) with its multinational participation, it ensures a common data representation, thereby facilitating the exchange of surveillance data in an international context.

Having started as a EUROCONTROL development (see the "history" section for further details), ASTERIX is now applied worldwide.

ASTERIX defines a structured approach to the encoding of surveillance data. Categories group the information related to a specific application. They consist of a number of data items which are defined in the ASTERIX documents down to the bit-level.
